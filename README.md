# TFToolbox

A passion project by Michael Kim and Alex Bai to create tools for TeamFight Tactics that help players improve decision-making during games.

Currently, we are working on implementing puzzles using a TFT simulator, allowing players to practice positioning of champions to win in different matchups. This project is currently in alpha and new features are being implemented every day.
